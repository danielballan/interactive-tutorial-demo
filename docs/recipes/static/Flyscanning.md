# FlyScanning

Fly scanning is a high-speed scanning technique designed to enhance beamline efficiency. Traditionally, step scanning is used, where the sample rotation must pause to allow the detector to capture data. Fly scanning overcomes this limitation by keeping the sample in continuous rotation. A trigger system generates signals based on the sample's position, allowing data collection without halting the sample movement.
